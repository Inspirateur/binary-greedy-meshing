# binary-greedy-meshing
Originally a port of [Binary Greedy Meshing v2](https://github.com/cgerikj/binary-greedy-meshing) to Rust, with additional improvements such as support for transparent blocks.

## How to use
This crate is used in the Bevy voxel game [Riverbed](https://github.com/Inspirateur/riverbed), you can check out the code for usage examples.

### Minimal example
```rust
use binary_greedy_meshing as bgm;
use std::collections::BTreeSet;

fn main() {
    // This is a flattened 3D array of u16 in ZXY order, of size 64^3 
    // (it represents a 62^3-sized chunk that is padded with neighbor information)
    let mut voxels = [0; bgm::CS_P3];
    // Add 2 voxels at position 0;0;0 and 0;1;0
    voxels[bgm::pad_linearize(0, 0, 0)] = 1;
    voxels[bgm::pad_linearize(0, 1, 0)] = 1;
    // Contain useful buffers that can be cached and cleared 
    // with mesh_data.clear() to avoid re-allocation
    let mut mesh_data = bgm::MeshData::new();
    // Does the meshing, mesh_data.quads is the output
    // transparent block values are signaled by putting them in the BTreeSet
    bgm::mesh(&voxels, &mut mesh_data, BTreeSet::default());
}
```

### What to do with `mesh_data.quads`
`mesh_data.quads` is a `[Vec<u64>; 6]`, 1 Vec<u64> per face type, each u64 encoding all the information of a quad in the following manner:
```rust
(v_type << 32) | (h << 24) | (w << 18) | (z << 12) | (y << 6) | x
```

The face groups correspond to Up, Down, Right, Left, Front, Back, in this order. (assuming right handed Y up)

The fastest way of rendering quads is using instancing (check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40JzyaOYJeY) to learn more about the topic), but if it's not available you can still convert the quads to vertices and indices making a regular mesh, see this Riverbed files for an example of this:
- [src/render/mesh_utils.rs](https://github.com/Inspirateur/riverbed/blob/main/src/render/mesh_utils.rs) for Face+Quad => vertices conversion
- [src/render/mesh_chunks.rs](https://github.com/Inspirateur/riverbed/blob/main/src/render/mesh_chunks.rs) for the rest of the meshing code (+ LOD)

## Performance
Benching the crate on Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1650 v3 @ 3.50GHz:
- meshing (with transparency support): **400μs**

This is coherent with the 50-200μs range (without transparency) reported from the original C version of the library, as transparency incurrs a significant cost in the hidden face culling phase.

The meshing is also ~10x faster than [block-mesh-rs](https://github.com/bonsairobo/block-mesh-rs) which took **~4.5ms** to greedy mesh a chunk on my machine.

*chunk sizes are 62^3 (64^3 with padding) by default, this crate supports other sizes using const-generic*

### Minimal example with 32^3 chunk size
```rust
use binary_greedy_meshing as bgm;
use std::collections::BTreeSet;

fn main() {
    const CHUNK_SIZE: usize = 32;
    // MeshDataGeneric is the path with const-generic parameters
    use bgm::MeshDataGeneric as MD;
    // This is a flattened 3D array of u16 in ZXY order, of size (CHUNK_SIZE + 2)^3 
    // (it represents a CHUNK_SIZE^3-sized chunk that is padded with neighbor information)
    let mut voxels = [0; MD::<CHUNK_SIZE>::CS_P3];
    // Add 2 voxels at position 0;0;0 and 0;1;0
    voxels[bgm::pad_linearize_sized::<CHUNK_SIZE>(0, 0, 0)] = 1;
    voxels[bgm::pad_linearize_sized::<CHUNK_SIZE>(0, 1, 0)] = 1;
    // Contain useful buffers that can be cached and cleared 
    // with mesh_data.clear() to avoid re-allocation
    let mut mesh_data = bgm::MeshDataSized::<CHUNK_SIZE>::new();
    // Does the meshing, mesh_data.quads is the output
    // transparent block values are signaled by putting them in the BTreeSet
    bgm::mesh_sized::<CHUNK_SIZE>(&voxels, &mut mesh_data, BTreeSet::default());
}
```
